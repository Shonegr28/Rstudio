## Q 1
```{r}
# Question 1 Table
table = matrix(c(0.9212, 0.7455, 0.9932, 0.4482, 1.0, 0.7703), nrow=3, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE, dimnames = list(c('Match', 'Similar Distracter', 'Non-similar Distracter'), c('Fingerprint experts', 'Novices')))
table


```
### a.
```{r}
# Given a pair of matched prints. What is the probability that an expert will fail to identify the match?
failmatchprob = (1-table[1,1])/(sum(table["Match",]))
failmatchprob
```

### b.
```{r}
## Given a pair of matched prints, what is the probability that a novice will fail to identify the match?
novicefailmatchprob = (1- table[1,2])/(sum(table["Match",]))
novicefailmatchprob
```
### c.
Assume the study included 10 participants, 5 experts and 5 novices. Suppose that a pair of matched prints are presented to a randomly selected study participant and the participant fails to identify the match. Is the participant more likely to be an expert or a novice?

Novice, because the likelihood of a novice failing to find the match is higher than that of an expert


## Q 2

```{r}
table1 = matrix(c(50, 9, 50, 891), ncol=2, byrow=TRUE, dimnames = list(c('Positive', 'Negative'), c('Users', 'Non-users')))
addmargins(table1)
```

### a.
```{r}
# Given the athlete is a user, find the probability that a drug test for testosterone will yield a positive result. This probability represents the sensitivity of the drug test.

posuser =  (table1[1,1])/(sum(table1[,"Users"]))
posuser

```

### b. 
```{r}
#Given the athlete is a nonuser, find the probability that a drug test for testosterone will yield a negative result. This probability represents the specificity of the drug test.)
negnonuser = table1[2,2]/(sum(table1[,"Non-users"]))
negnonuser
```
### c.
```{r}
# IF an athlete tests positive for testosterone, use Bayes' Rule to find the probability that the athlete is really doping. (This probability represents the positive predictive value of the drug test.)
## Bayes' Rule = (P(Positive | Doping)*P(Doping))/P(Positive)
totalNonuserUser = sum(table1[, "Users"]) + sum(table1[, "Non-users"])
totalpositive=sum(table1["Positive",])
priorProbDope = sum(table1[,"Users"]) / totalNonuserUser
totalProbpostive = totalpositive/totalNonuserUser
reallyDoping = (posuser*priorProbDope)/totalProbpostive
reallyDoping


```
## Q 3

Base Case: For a single set with n‚ÇÅ elements, we can create n‚ÇÅ different samples by choosing one element. Thus, for k=1, the principle holds.
Inductive Step: Assume the principle holds for k sets, i.e., the number of samples is n‚ÇÅ * n‚ÇÇ * ... * n‚Çñ.
For k+1 sets, consider the samples from k sets (n‚ÇÅ * n‚ÇÇ * ... * n‚Çñ) and pair each with an element from the (k+1)th set (n‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ). This results in (n‚ÇÅ * n‚ÇÇ * ... * n‚Çñ) * n‚Çñ‚Çä‚ÇÅ samples.
Therefore, by induction, the Multiplicative Principle holds for all k ‚àà ‚Ñï. for allùëò‚àà‚Ñïk‚ààN

### b. 
Discuss the conditions that would make the researchers' Poisson assumption plausible.

The experiment involves recording how often the event Y, which is rare, happens within a specific period, area, volume, or any other defined measurement unit.
The likelihood of the event occurring is consistent across all units of time, area, or volume, and these units do not overlap.
The occurrence of events in one unit is independent of their occurrence in any other unit.
